Code Analysis

Objective:
The objective of the function is to take a list of elements and sort them based on the number of occurrences of each element in the list. The function combines same elements and returns a list sorted by the number of occurrences of each combined element.

Inputs:
- list_of_stuff (List): A list with multiple same elements.

Flow:
1. The function takes a list of elements as input.
2. The Counter function from the collections module is used to count the occurrences of each element in the list.
3. The sorted function is used to sort the Counter object based on the count of each element in the original list, in descending order.
4. The sorted list is returned as output.

Outputs:
- List: A sorted list of elements based on the number of occurrences of each combined element.

Additional aspects:
- The function uses the Counter function to count the occurrences of each element in the list.
- The key parameter of the sorted function is set to list_of_stuff.count, which returns the count of each element in the original list.
- The reverse parameter of the sorted function is set to True, which sorts the list in descending order.
